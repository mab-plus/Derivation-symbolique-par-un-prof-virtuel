/**
 * Graphics is the abstract base class for all graphics contexts
 * which allow an application to draw onto components realized on
 * various devices or onto off-screen images.
 * A Graphics object encapsulates the state information needed
 * for the various rendering operations that Java supports.  This
 * state information includes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The Component to draw on
 * <li>A translation origin for rendering and clipping coordinates
 * <li>The current clip
 * <li>The current color
 * <li>The current font
 * <li>The current logical pixel operation function (XOR or Paint)
 * <li>The current XOR alternation color
 *     (see <a href="#setXORMode">setXORMode</a>)
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Coordinates are infinitely thin and lie between the pixels of the
 * output device.
 * Operations which draw the outline of a figure operate by traversing
 * along the infinitely thin path with a pixel-sized pen that hangs
 * down and to the right of the anchor point on the path.
 * Operations which fill a figure operate by filling the interior
 * of the infinitely thin path.
 * Operations which render horizontal text render the ascending
 * portion of the characters entirely above the baseline coordinate.
 * <p>
 * Some important points to consider are that drawing a figure that
 * covers a given rectangle will occupy one extra row of pixels on
 * the right and bottom edges compared to filling a figure that is
 * bounded by that same rectangle.
 * Also, drawing a horizontal line along the same y coordinate as
 * the baseline of a line of text will draw the line entirely below
 * the text except for any descenders.
 * Both of these properties are due to the pen hanging down and to
 * the right from the path that it traverses.
 * <p>
 * All coordinates which appear as arguments to the methods of this
 * Graphics object are considered relative to the translation origin
 * of this Graphics object prior to the invocation of the method.
 * All rendering operations modify only pixels which lie within the
 * area bounded by both the current clip of the graphics context
 * and the extents of the Component used to create the Graphics object.
